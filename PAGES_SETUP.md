Digital PIN â€” GitHub Pages setup
=================================

Status: index.html pushed to `main` (2025-08-26)

What I did
----------
- Created a single-file docs-style site: `index.html` (RTL default, embedded SVG logo, brand colors #0A47A3 & #09A66D).
- Initialized a git repo in `digital-pins.github.io/` and pushed `main` -> `origin/main` on https://github.com/Digital-Pins/digital-pins.github.io.

Pages activation
----------------
GitHub Pages usually needs the repo `main` branch (or `gh-pages`) to be set as the site source.

If Pages is not yet active, do one of the following (requires repo admin):

1) In the GitHub web UI
   - Go to the repository: https://github.com/Digital-Pins/digital-pins.github.io
   - Settings -> Pages
   - Under "Build and deployment" choose Branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
   - Save. Wait ~1-2 minutes for the site to become available.

2) Using gh CLI (if you prefer):
   gh repo edit Digital-Pins/digital-pins.github.io --enable-pages
   gh api -X POST repos/Digital-Pins/digital-pins.github.io/pages/builds

Verification
------------
- Once enabled, the site should be available at: https://digital-pins.github.io
- To test locally before publishing:
  - cd digital-pins.github.io
  - python3 -m http.server 8000
  - open http://localhost:8000

Notes and next steps (assistant as partner)
------------------------------------------
- I pushed the initial single-file site. I can:
  - Enable Pages via the GitHub API if you provide a token with repo admin scope.
  - Add a small CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to validate/preview the site on pushes.
  - Expand the docs into multiple pages or convert markdown to HTML automatically.

Tell me which next step you want me to take and I'll perform it and record the action here.
